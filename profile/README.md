## Hello, this is us ðŸ‘‹

![The Basevi designed Founder's Building of the Fitzwilliam Museum](https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/fitz_portico.jpeg)

The Fitzwilliam Museum's Digital output was based around 3 pillars of open computing:

1. Open Data
2. Open Science 
3. Open Licenses

We strived to create software and datasets that were liberally licensed eg MIT/GPL for software and CC 0 for metadata. Images are more strictly controlled by the University of Cambridge and are CC BY-NC-ND. 

The majority of the software and website code in these repositories has been written by Daniel Pett, with some input from team members (Georgina Doji, Oliver Warren, and Henry Evans.)

Curatorial colleagues have been instrumental in creating resources and learning to code (take a bow Helen Strudwick, Rebecca Roberts, Anastasia Christophilopoulou, Melanie Pitkin, Jana Mokrisova, Lisa Gee, and Megan Bushnell). Our AHRC funded
Creative Economy Engagement Fellows (Abi L. Glen, Jennifer Wexler, Cat Cooper and Melanie Pitkin) generated 3d models, web resources and audio visual materials which are deployed here in conjunction with ThinkSee3d and Museum in a Box.
As part of our AHRC funded Linking Islands of Data network, various international partners collaborated on linked open data and visualisation.

We have various external contributors, for example Rainer Simon, Tom Elliot, Alexa SteinbrÃ¼ck, Philo van Kemanade and work with Cambridge Digital Humanities and Olamalu. 

Please do fork, remix or reuse the code we have created.
