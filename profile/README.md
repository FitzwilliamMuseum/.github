## Hello, this is us 👋

![The Basevi designed Founder's Building of the Fitzwilliam Museum](https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/fitz_portico.jpeg)

The Fitzwilliam Museum's Digital output was based around 3 pillars of open computing:

1. Open Data
2. Open Science 
3. Open Licenses

We strived to create software and datasets that were liberally licensed eg MIT/GPL for software and CC-BY/CC0 for metadata. Images are more strictly controlled by the University of Cambridge and are CC-BY-NC-SA-ND. 

The majority of the software and website code in these repositories has been written by Daniel Pett, but curatorial colleagues have been instrumental in creating resources and learning to code. We have various external contributors, for example Rainer Simon, Tom Elliot, Philo van Kemanade. 

Please do fork, remix or reuse the code we have created.
